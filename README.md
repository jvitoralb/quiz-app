# Quiz App

This App was created using React and CSS only.  
All questions are retrieved from [The Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com/) using an API call.  
The project goal was to practice Front End development with React!

Playing this quiz game you might encounter the same question twice given the fact that this app does not use Sessions Tokens to keep track of questions already retrieved.
